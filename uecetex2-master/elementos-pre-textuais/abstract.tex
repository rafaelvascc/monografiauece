The choice of the technologies to be used and the target platforms, is the first step taken when building a software. Systems for the web platform  can be written in many languages and use many frameworks and techniques. It is common to witness arguments between developers about which is the best technology to build a system, along with technical and objective arguments, are presented subjective ones, based on the developers preference. Among technologies for web development where is found great rivalry between their users, and discussions about their pros and cons, are the technologies that uses Oracle's Java programming language and Microsoft's .NET framework. This monograph presents the creation of a simple software for the web using both technologies, with code samples side by side, highlighting advantages and disadvantages one technology has on the other. The project written in the Java language uses the frameworks Spring and Hibernate. The project that uses the .NET Framework is written with the language C\# and uses \est{ASP.NET MVC 5} and \est{Entity Framework 6}.
